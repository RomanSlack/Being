# Recording Script — 5 Minute Training Video

## Before Recording

- Sit with consistent lighting (front-lit, no harsh shadows)
- Frame: head + shoulders, some space above head for hair
- Look directly at camera as your "center" position
- Speak at a natural conversational pace
- Follow the [bracketed directions] for movements
- If you stumble on a line, just pause and redo it — don't restart
- Keep shoulders relatively still, move from the neck
- Make sure the top of your head has clearance in frame

## Section 1: Warm-Up & Calibration (~45 seconds)

> [Look straight at camera, neutral face]

Hello. My name is Roman, and I'm recording this video to create a digital version of myself. I'm going to speak naturally for a few minutes, moving my head around and making different expressions.

> [Slow nod up and down, twice]

Let me start by just looking around a little bit.

> [Slowly turn head LEFT about 30 degrees, hold 2 seconds]
> [Slowly turn head RIGHT about 30 degrees, hold 2 seconds]
> [Back to center]
> [Tilt head slightly LEFT, hold 2 seconds]
> [Tilt head slightly RIGHT, hold 2 seconds]
> [Back to center]
> [Look slightly UP, hold 2 seconds]
> [Look slightly DOWN, hold 2 seconds]
> [Back to center]

## Section 2: Phoneme Diversity — Conversational (~60 seconds)

> [Natural head movement — don't stay frozen, gently shift as you would in a real conversation]

So, the thing about building technology is that you never quite know where it's going to take you. Five years ago, I would have thought this was pure science fiction. But here we are, just casually teaching a computer what my face looks like.

> [Slight smile]

The funny part is how much detail matters. Every little movement — the way my jaw drops open when I say "wow,"

> [Open mouth wide on "wow"]

or how my lips push forward for "oooh,"

> [Exaggerate lips forward on "oooh"]

or pull back for "cheese."

> [Big smile on "cheese," showing teeth]

Even the way my eyebrows move changes everything.

> [Raise eyebrows on "everything"]

---

## Section 3: Teeth & Mouth Interior (~45 seconds)

> [Look at camera, speak clearly with slightly exaggerated mouth openings]

Let me count out loud. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

> [Slowly, mouth open wider than normal]

Now some open vowels: Ah. Oh. Ooh. Eee. Ay.

> [Hold each vowel for a full second, mouth wide]

And some big words: Absolutely. Extraordinary. Fundamentally. Enthusiastically. Unbelievable.

> [Smile wide, teeth visible]

Ha ha ha. Hee hee hee.

> [Genuine laugh if you can, or fake a natural one — showing teeth and mouth interior]

That was a terrible fake laugh, but it works.

> [Grin]

---

## Section 4: Head Movement + Speech (~60 seconds)

> [This section: speak while actively moving. The model needs to learn speech + motion simultaneously]

> [Turn head slightly left, speak to an imaginary person]

You know what I think? I think the most interesting problems are the ones nobody's solved yet. That's what makes them worth working on.

> [Turn head slightly right, as if responding to someone else]

Yeah, exactly. And the challenge isn't just the technical side — it's figuring out what to build in the first place. That's the hard part.

> [Look back at camera, nod slowly while speaking]

But when you get it right, when something actually works the way you imagined it — that feeling is incredible.

> [Tilt head slightly, thoughtful expression]

It makes all the debugging and frustration completely worth it.

> [Slight head shake, like "no"]

I wouldn't trade it for anything.

---

## Section 5: Expression Variety (~45 seconds)

> [Neutral face]

Sometimes things go exactly as planned.

> [Surprised — raise eyebrows, open mouth slightly]

And sometimes they absolutely do not.

> [Frustrated / slight frown]

Like when you spend three hours on a bug that turns out to be a typo. A single missing comma.

> [Eye roll, slight smirk]

Classic.

> [Genuine smile]

But honestly, those are the stories you end up telling people about. The disasters make the best stories.

> [Serious, direct at camera]

The important thing is that you keep going.

> [Warm smile]

And you do. You always do.

## Section 6: Rapid Phoneme Coverage (~45 seconds)

> [Natural movement, clear pronunciation. These sentences hit every English phoneme]

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

She sells seashells by the seashore.

Unique New York. You know you need unique New York.

Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

> [Slightly slower]

The thick leather journal was a birthday present from my brother, who lives in southern New Zealand.

She wore a gorgeous azure dress with a beige jacket to the theatre on Thursday evening.

How much wood would a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

> [Small smile]

I just said all of that with a straight face.

---

## Section 7: Natural Monologue + Movement (~60 seconds)

> [Most natural section — just talk like you're on a video call. Move freely. Gesture if you want to, but keep hands below frame]

Alright, let me just talk normally for a bit. This is basically what I look like on a Zoom call, right? Just a person sitting here, talking about whatever comes to mind.

> [Look slightly off-camera as if thinking, then back]

I've been thinking a lot lately about how weird it is that we can do this — take a few minutes of video and turn it into something that can speak any words. It's a little surreal.

> [Nod]

But also kind of amazing. I mean, think about what this enables. You could create educational content in any language. You could have a version of yourself that handles video messages while you're busy.

> [Slight lean forward, like you're making a point]

The possibilities are genuinely exciting. And we're still in the early days.

> [Lean back, relaxed]

Anyway, I think that's probably enough material. Let me wrap this up.

---

## Section 8: Closing Calibration (~30 seconds)

> [Repeat the head movement calibration from Section 1]

> [Slowly turn head LEFT 30 degrees, hold 2 seconds]
> [Slowly turn head RIGHT 30 degrees, hold 2 seconds]
> [Look UP slightly, hold 2 seconds]
> [Look DOWN slightly, hold 2 seconds]
> [Tilt LEFT, hold 2 seconds]
> [Tilt RIGHT, hold 2 seconds]

> [Back to center, neutral face, hold 3 seconds]

> [Smile, hold 3 seconds]

> [Neutral again, hold 3 seconds]

And we're done.

> [End recording]
